# Refactored Code for Horiseon Website

## Description

The original code for the Horiseon website has been refactored so that the title element is descriptive and specific to the website (Horiseon), images are given alt text, and HTML tags are more descriptive. The CSS has been updated to reflect changes to tags used.
